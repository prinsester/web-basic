          <td>SMPN 3 Touluaan selected to be one of the schools from Southeast Minahasa to include the OSIS chairman in the Provincial Student Leadership Basic Training. I held simple competitions such as decorating the classroom to add the aesthetics and comfort of students and teachers in the school environment. And made a few small changes such as the scheduling of the ceremonial officers from each class so that all students could participate directly and become active students in the school.</td>
